<h3>The Lord of The Rings</h3>

    Favorite trilogy. Story very well written, a true masterpiece.

<h3>The Hobbit</h3>
<p>
    Just like LOTR, a masterpiece. The first part of its story.
</p>
<h3>Ice Age</h3>
<p>
    Favorite animation. A hard pick compared to How to Train Your Dragon, but Sid is just amazing.
