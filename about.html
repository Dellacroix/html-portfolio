<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Born in Brazil. Started taking an interest in the English language since the beginning of everything. That passion
  always filled my heart with joy to a point where I couldn't think of doing anything without doing it in English,
  despite not knowing the language at the time. Without even trying English became a part of my life, and learning it
  was inevitable. I always had good grades in English with no effort whatsoever, and I never understood why. At least 
  at that time.

  Looking back I realized that growing up I had many differents interests. Always jumping from one topic to another,
  could never seem to stick to one thing only. Until I started taking an interest on dancing. Dance changed my life 
  completely and I can't even remember a time when I didn't dance. Because of a friend, at that time, dance became a
  huge part of my life. Until the group I was dancing at fell apart in 2018.

  After that it felt like I didnt' have a purpose anymore. And sadly that feeling continues up until now. However, I
  never gave up on finding my true purpose. It hasn't been easy, and I had several challenges on my path, but all of
  them were overcome. That's the beauty of life though. Still on the search of my purpose, also on the lookout for 
  someone to look with. But that's a story for another day.
